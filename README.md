# CloudFlare Purge Plugin
Welcome to the CloudFlare Purge Plugin repository.
CF-Purge is a chrome extension that purges the cache for the current URL on CloudFlare enabled websites.
You can find the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloudflare-purge-plugin/nbpecchpcfacahhekolpaofpmogkmmok).

Please visit the "Cloudflare Purge Plugin" website at [www.cf-purge.com](http://www.cf-purge.com) to find more information.

The CloudFlare purge plugin uses the CloudFlare API to purge any page of a website that serves its contents through the CloudFlare CDN. After you set your CF e-mail and API key in the options, you can purge the cache of any page of your CF enabled website. After version 1.3, you can purge the entire cache for the domain of your current tab.

### Changeset
